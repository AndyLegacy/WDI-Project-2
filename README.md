WDI 2nd Project

The Lifting Lab

Setup:

To install the project clone the repository and use yarn to install the dependencies. Use the command gulp in your terminal to compile the source code and open in browser.

Note * You'll need to have mongodb installed globally and have mongod running on port 27017.

Brief:

The project is a crowdsourced and user based app in which people competing in the sport of powerlifting, can review exist training programs and post their own in the forums for discussion. The idea is to provide powerlifters a space where they can exclusively talk about their training.

Technologies:

HTML 5 SCSS JavaScript ES6 jQuery 3.10 Gulp Yarn Git & github Node.JS, BootStrap

Challenges:

The initial challenge was working out how the site would work with a database; trying to visualise what I wanted and executing it according to plan. The models, routes and seeds file we're simple to do once i had done my initial planning, but a major challenging was the bug fixing associated to user authentication such as giving access editing or deleting posts made by the user who posted them.


Conclusion:
Overall I feel as though this project as been a big win for me, i've created what I set out to do and got a large part of the functionality down and working. In future versions of this project I aim to add extra features, such as a user profile page and a post subscription system where users can view what posts they have favourited. I also intend to create a points ranking system where users reputations can be judged by the  quality of their posts by other users. I would also like to features an internal messaging system where users can have private chats with other users. I also intend to create calculators for people in the sport, such as protein intake, max training percentage calculators, macro splits etc.
